# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/doc/
/rdoc/

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

.sass-cache

# Ignore _site/
# When using GitHub pages, GitHub ignores the _site folder
# it should only be used when developing locally with jekyll s
# or when deploying to a non-GH host
/_site
# Ignore .jekyll-metadata
#This file is generated for caching when using jekyll s --incremental 
.jekyll-metadata
