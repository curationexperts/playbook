# Project Management with Waffle

We prefer to use github tickets for managing issues, and waffle.io to visualize 
our flow of work. We also want to be able to visualize all of the work happening
at DCE across all current projects at https://waffle.io/curationexperts/in-house.

In order to display all projects consistently, and so that we can have shared 
expectations and understanding of a ticket's state, we want to always use the 
same column headings in our waffle boards. These are:

1. Inbox - Default waffle column. Newly created tickets go here automatically.
1. Backlog - Tickets that have been priority ranked in relation to other tickets.
1. Next - Tickets that are ready for work (i.e., they have acceptance criteria, and they have been pointed by the team)
1. In Progress - Someone is actively working on this ticket. In order to be in-progress, it should have a name attached. 
1. Review - Tickets whose work has been completed and that are ready for review and/or inclusion in a demo.
1. Done - Tickets that have been closed. 

As of this writing, these are the default heading names for a newly created waffle board.

*Note:* Please do *not* use "Closes ticket #whatever" in github pull requests. Please instead use "Connected to #whatever" and put your ticket in the "Review" column.
