# Continuous Integration

We use travis-ci.org for our CI builds whenever possible. See [https://travis-ci.org/curationexperts](https://travis-ci.org/curationexperts) for the current list.

We also believe that CI is a value, and an attitude, not just a task. Read [this article](https://github.com/oreillymedia/97-things-every-agile-developer-should-know/blob/master/CI_attitude.asciidoc) for more context.
