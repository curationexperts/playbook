# Code Review

When we review each other's work we build shared expertise and produce higher quality projects. We expect that all changes to project code will go through a github pull request process and be reviewed by a team mate before being merged.

We aspire to [egoless code reviews](https://github.com/oreillymedia/97-things-every-agile-developer-should-know/blob/master/Egoless_Code_Reviews.asciidoc).
