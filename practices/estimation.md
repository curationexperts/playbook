# Estimation

We need to be able to estimate and measure the velocity of our work, and to do
this we estimate the sizes of tickets on our waffle board. Possible sizes are:

* **1** - The smallest meaningful measure of work.  A task that is 2 hours or less.
* **2** - About half a day
* **3** - About a day
* **5** - 2 - 3 days
* **8** - About a week
* **13** - Needs to be broken down into something smaller

Although numbers larger than 13 exist in the interface, we try to only use points
up to 13. Anything pointed with 13 or larger is an indication that the ticket 
should be broken down into smaller tasks.

Task size assumes what you could accomplish without interruption. Elapsed time
might be longer. However, do take into consideration non-code writing tasks like
returning emails, going back and forth with a client, holding meetings about a feature,
etc.
