# Environment Variables

We use environment variables to manage information that should not be checked into
version control, but that is required for the running of a project. This might include
passwords, mail server settings, API keys, and other kinds of data that is sensitive
or deployment-specific.

Here are some good places to read about best practices to which we aspire on this subject:
